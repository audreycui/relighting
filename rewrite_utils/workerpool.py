'''
WorkerPool and WorkerBase for handling the common problems in managing
a multiprocess pool of workers that aren't done by multiprocessing.Pool,
including setup with per-process state, debugging by putting the worker
on the main thread, and correct handling of unexpected errors, and ctrl-C.

While the pytorch DataLoader is helpful for fast reading of data in
parallel, a utility is needed for fast writing of data.  This worker
class simpliifies this problem - by David Bau.

To use it,
1. Put the per-process setup and the per-task work in the
   setup() and work() methods of your own WorkerBase subclass.
2. To prepare the process pool, instantiate a WorkerPool, passing your
   subclass type as the first (worker) argument, as well as any setup keyword
   arguments.  The WorkerPool will instantiate one of your workers in each
   worker process (passing in the setup arguments in those processes).
   If debugging, the pool can have process_count=0 to force all the work
   to be done immediately on the main thread; otherwise all the work
   will be passed to other processes.
3. Whenever there is a new piece of work to distribute, call pool.add(*args).
   The arguments will be queued and passed as worker.work(*args) to the
   next available worker.
4. When all the work has been distributed, call pool.join() to wait for all
   the work to complete and to finish and terminate all the worker processes.
   When pool.join() returns, all the work will have been done.

No arrangement is made to collect the results of the work: for example,
the return value of work() is ignored.  If you need to collect the
results, use your own mechanism (filesystem, shared memory object, queue)
which can be distributed using setup arguments.
